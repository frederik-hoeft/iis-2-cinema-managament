This work presented a case study that highlighted easily exploitable attack vectors that most anti-virus engines failed to detect. It was determined that threat actors could utilize these adversarial approaches to extract confidential information from the virtual memory of a running process. Moreover, the limitations and shortcomings of existing methods for protecting sensitive data in memory in .NET (primarily a lack of portability) were identified and translated into requirements for a new solution called XXX. \todo{copy-pasted from Ubi :P}
