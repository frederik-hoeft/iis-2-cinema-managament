\chapter{Abstract}

\todo{first draft:}
As digitalization progresses, more and more industries require software solutions that can be adapted to their specific needs. In the area of cinema management, such an approach is necessary, as the individual cinemas vary greatly in their size, equipment, and business model. The goal of this work is to develop a network-based solution for managing core cinema infrastructure, such as cinema halls, movie showtimes, and ticket sales.

\hspace{-.6cm}In order to achieve this goal, concrete use cases are analyzed and drafted into a requirements specification. Based on these requirements, a conceptual design is created, which includes a client-server architecture and a data model. The conceptual design is then implemented in Java prototype, leveraging MPS as a modeling language for the data model and Spring Boot for the API. A C\# Client is developed as a proof of concept, which communicates with the server, and a command line interface is created for user interaction.

\hspace{-.6cm}Although the prototype meets the requirements, it is not production-ready, as it lacks a user interface, authentication, and error handling. Further work is required to create a fully functional application that can be used in a real-world scenario.
